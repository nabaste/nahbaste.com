                                    While studying graphic design at University of Buenos Aires, I
                                    was always looking for new ways in which design met technology. I got into UI and
                                    UX,
                                    interested in designing interactions. But somehow designing interfaces wasn’t
                                    enough.
                                    I learned to code in order to make websites, and was thrilled to work with react
                                    designing PWAs. I later discovered OpenFrameworks and got into C and GLSL. I love
                                    the
                                    way in which you can create procedural images with code, the elegant simplicity of
                                    it.
                                    I’m a self-taught programmer, I always enjoyed learning how things work, taking them
                                    apart and playing with the pieces.
                                    Some time later I got into 3D modeling with Maya, I took an online course
                                    on hard surface modeling and I got the hang of it pretty fast. I learned some
                                    organic
                                    sculpting as well in Zbrush.
                                    And then one day last year every piece of the puzzle fell into place, and I realized
                                    that AR was the place where everything I had done came together. Taking design to
                                    the 3D
                                    space, designing interactive experiences and assets.



                                <p><span class="image right"><img src="../assets/images/ProfileHome.jpg"
                                            alt="" /></span>
                                    I’m always interested in ways in which
                                    design and technology meet to tackle real world challenges. Technology has the
                                    immense
                                    power to change the lives of so many people, and that requires an ethical exercise
                                    of
                                    design and development.
                                    I love designing interactive experiences, from an interface to an AR experience.
                                    Design
                                    should empower people, help them be more comfortable & confident to achieve their
                                    goals.
                                    I think the XR space will radically change how we conceive information, both visual
                                    and conceptual.
                                    Im a big believer in decentralization, the power of blockchain technology to secure
                                    and
                                    develop public goods, while also creating consensus for common causes.
